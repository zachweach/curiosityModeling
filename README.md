## Honeycomb Havoc!

Honeycomb Havoc(https://www.mariowiki.com/Honeycomb_Havoc) is a Mario Party minigame first introduced in Mario Party 2. It is inspired by the classical game Nim(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)

For this project, we ask that you submit a README that explains your implementation. At a minimum, you should address each of the following points:

### What are we trying to model?
Include a brief description that would give someone unfamiliar with the topic a basic understanding of your goal.

### Overview of the model design choices
#### checks and run statements

#### Sterling visualizer

#### How should we look at and interpret an instance created by your spec?

#### Custom visualization.

### At a high level, what do each of your sigs and preds represent in the context of the model? Justify the purpose for their existence and how they fit together.
